```

### Kubernetes setup

Add to your kubernetes the deployment your the livenessProbe

example with recommended setup:

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: my_app
      image: my_app:latest
      env:
        - name: RAILS_ENV
          value: production
      command:
        - bundle
        - exec
        - sidekiq
      ports:
        - containerPort: 7433
      livenessProbe:
        httpGet:
          path: /
          port: 7433
        initialDelaySeconds: 80 # app specific. Time your sidekiq takes to start processing.
        timeoutSeconds: 5 # can be much less
      readinessProbe:
        httpGet:
          path: /
          port: 7433
        initialDelaySeconds: 80 # app specific
        timeoutSeconds: 5 # can be much less
      lifecycle:
        preStop:
          exec:
            # SIGTERM triggers a quick exit; gracefully terminate instead
            command: ["bundle", "exec", "sidekiqctl", "quiet"]
  terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 60 # put your longest Job time here plus security time.
```

## Options

```ruby
SidekiqAlive.setup do |config|
  # ==> Server port
  # port to bind the server
  # default: 7433
  #
  #   config.port = 7433

  # ==> Liveness key
  # Key to be stored in redis as probe of liveness
  # default: "SIDEKIQ::LIVENESS_PROBE_TIMESTAMP"
  #
  #   config.liveness_key = "SIDEKIQ::LIVENESS_PROBE_TIMESTAMP"

  # ==> Time to live
  # Time for the key to be kept by redis.
  # Here is where you can set de periodicity that the sidekiq has to probe it is working
  # Time unit: seconds
  # default: 10 * 60 # 10 minutes
  #
  #   config.time_to_live = 10 * 60

  # ==> Callback
  # After the key is stored in redis you can perform anything.
  # For example a webhook or email to notify the team
  # default: proc {}
  #
  #    require 'net/http'
  #    config.callback = proc { Net::HTTP.get("https://status.com/ping") }
